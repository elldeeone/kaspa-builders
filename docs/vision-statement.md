# Kaspa Builders — Vision Statement

Kaspa Builders are people who help grow Kaspa—through whatever they’re best at.

Whether building content, writing code, organising events, answering questions, or helping someone install their first wallet, any contribution counts.

Being a developer is not a requirement. Caring enough to help is enough to belong here.

It’s not a program or a team. There are no roles, applications, or approvals. Just people doing the work because they believe in what Kaspa stands for.

## How Participation Works

- Anyone can participate, from anywhere in the world  
- Resources are public, remixable, and community-owned  
- If funding is available, small grants may support impactful work

## Monthly Focus

Each month, a simple focus is suggested—like merchant outreach, mining education, or content translation—to encourage new contributions.

Participation is completely optional, but it helps create rhythm, connection, and momentum across the community.

## Ethos

No one speaks *for* Kaspa—but many speak *about* it.

Contributions come from a place of belief in what Kaspa represents, trusting that real value emerges from open collaboration.
