# Kaspa Builders — Vision Statement

Kaspa Builders are people who help grow Kaspa—through whatever they’re best at.

Whether you’re building content, writing code, organising events, answering questions, or helping someone install their first wallet, you’re contributing.

You don’t need to be a developer. If you care enough to help, you already belong here.

It’s not a program or a team. There are no roles, applications, or approvals. Just people doing the work because they believe in what Kaspa stands for.

## How We Work

- Anyone can participate, anywhere in the world  
- All resources are public, remixable, and community-owned  
- Contributors are encouraged to post their work publicly and reference “Kaspa Builders” so others can follow, remix, or build alongside  
- Light coordination helps connect and highlight great work  
- If funding is available, small grants may support impactful contributions

## Monthly Focus

Each month, we propose a simple focus—like merchant outreach, mining education, or content translation—to inspire new contributions.

It’s completely optional, but it helps create rhythm, connection, and momentum across the community.

## Our Ethos

No one speaks *for* Kaspa—but many speak *about* it.

We contribute because we believe in Kaspa’s potential, and we trust that real value emerges from open collaboration.
