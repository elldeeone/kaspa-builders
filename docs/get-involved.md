# Get Involved with Kaspa Builders

You don’t need a title or a role to start contributing.

Kaspa Builders is simply people helping Kaspa grow—by doing what they can, in the ways that make sense to them.

If you’re here and ready to act, you’re already on the right path.

## How to Contribute

There’s no single way to contribute. Below are just a few of the many ways people are already helping:

- Share educational posts or create explainers  
- Translate content or help localise key resources  
- Host a local meetup or a casual event  
- Help someone install their first wallet  
- Reach out to miners, merchants, or exchanges  
- Build tools, dashboards, or onboarding guides  
- Answer questions in Discord, Telegram, X, Reddit, or any social media platform  
- Start a regional working group or initiative  
- Record a video, write an article, or host a podcast  

If it brings value to the community—it counts.

## Where to Begin

- Join the [Kaspa Discord](https://discord.gg/kaspa) or [Telegram](https://t.me/Kaspa_global)  
- Pick something from the “How to Contribute” list above  
- Remix or localise a resource that already exists  
- Introduce yourself and ask where help is needed  
- Choose a focus from the current [Monthly Focus] theme (optional)  
- Or just start building and share your work when you’re ready

There’s no single path—only forward motion.

## What If You Were an Ambassador?

Some people got involved through the original Kaspa Ambassador Program. Others found their own path. Some still use the Ambassador title. Others prefer “Builder.” Neither is wrong.

Kaspa Builders doesn’t replace what came before—it grows from it.

If you’ve supported Kaspa through education, outreach, or action, you’re already doing the work. Whether you call yourself an Ambassador, a Builder, or simply a supporter is entirely up to you.

## Going Deeper

Once you're active and feeling connected, you might:
- Start a local working group or meet regularly with others in your region  
- Propose or participate in open initiatives  
- Explore community-led funding opportunities that may exist for high-impact contributions
- Share learnings with the broader community to help others do the same  

There’s no pressure to scale. But there’s always room to deepen your impact.
