Welcome to the Kaspa Builders community repository! This is where we organise and share resources to help grow the Kaspa ecosystem.

## About

Kaspa Builders are people who help grow Kaspa—through whatever they're best at. Whether you're building content, writing code, organising events, answering questions, or helping someone install their first wallet, you're contributing.

You don't need to be a developer. If you care enough to help, you already belong here.
