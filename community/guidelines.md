# Kaspa Builders — Community Guidelines

## Introduction

There’s no central authority in Kaspa—and the same is true here.

Being part of Kaspa Builders, or contributing to the broader Kaspa ecosystem in any way, is self-directed. No one is required to follow rules or adopt titles. You are accountable only to yourself.

That said, if you're looking for a shared culture to build within—these are the values we suggest, inspired by the way Kaspa has grown so far: openly, collaboratively, and without gatekeepers.

## 1. Why This Exists

These guidelines aren’t about permission or enforcement.  
They’re here to help create a space where:
- Collaboration is constructive  
- Contributions are respected  
- New participants feel welcome  
- The vibe reflects Kaspa’s spirit

You’re free to take what resonates and leave what doesn’t.  
As with Kaspa: the code is open, and so is the culture.

## 2. Shared Values (Suggested, Not Enforced)

- **Authenticity**  
  Be genuine in your support for Kaspa. There's no need to pretend, promote, or posture.

- **Integrity**  
  Be transparent in your work. Avoid misleading claims or behaviour.

- **Respect**  
  Treat others with kindness, even in disagreement. Debate ideas, not identities.

- **Initiative**  
  Don’t wait for someone to tell you what to do. Start something and invite others in.

- **Collaboration**  
  Build in the open. Give credit. Share knowledge.

- **Modesty**  
  No one needs to be “in charge” here. Let your work speak for itself.

## 3. Constructive Participation

Some general patterns that tend to work well:

- Be kind, curious, and open-minded  
- Support new contributors where you can  
- Share what you’re working on  
- Credit others when you build on their ideas  
- Avoid drama—Kaspa’s too important for that

## 4. On the Name “Kaspa Builders”

Kaspa Builders isn’t a company, a program, or a team.  
It’s just a name for people who are actively building, supporting, or educating around Kaspa.

You're welcome to use the name informally, such as:
- “I created this as part of the Kaspa Builders community.”
- “This guide was developed by contributors within Kaspa Builders.”

Please avoid using it to suggest:
- That you represent Kaspa or any official group  
- That you speak on behalf of anyone else  
- That funding, endorsement, or leadership roles are implied

## 5. If Things Go Sideways

Most disagreements resolve naturally. But if someone consistently disrupts, misrepresents, or causes harm, some shared spaces (like Discord channels or working groups) may set boundaries.

These boundaries, when needed, are guided by shared values rather than enforced authority.  
There’s no central moderator, but communities self-regulate—just like the network itself.

## 6. Clarifying the Relationship with the Ambassador Program

The Kaspa Ambassador Program played a meaningful role in helping the community grow early on, bringing together people from around the world to support the project through education, events, and grassroots outreach.

Kaspa Builders isn't a replacement—it’s a natural progression. Many who contributed as Ambassadors still do, and may now identify as Builders, or both. The titles aren’t what matter. What matters is the intent behind the work.

This shift isn’t about abandoning structure—it’s about removing barriers.  
It welcomes participation without requiring roles, labels, or permission.

Kaspa continues to grow—and so does how we contribute.  
Kaspa Builders reflects that evolution.

## 7. Final Thought

If you're reading this, you're already contributing to the culture.

You don’t need permission to help Kaspa grow—just the willingness to act in good faith.  
We hope these values help guide you as you build, speak, and connect with others in the ecosystem.
