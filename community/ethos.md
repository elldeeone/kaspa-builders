# Kaspa Builders — Ethos

There’s no central authority in Kaspa—and the same is true here.

Calling yourself a Kaspa Builder, or contributing to the broader Kaspa ecosystem in any way, is self-directed. No one is required to follow rules or adopt titles. Accountability is personal.

If you're looking for a shared culture to build within—these are just some ideas that have helped shape the community. They might change tomorrow, or they might continue as they are.

## Shared Ideas That Have Worked

These aren’t rules—they’re just ideas that have worked so far. 

The aim is to create a space where:
- Collaboration is constructive  
- Contributions are respected  
- New participants feel welcome  
- The vibe reflects Kaspa’s spirit  

Here are some values that have helped shape the community:

- **Authenticity**  
  Genuine support for Kaspa is valued. There's no need to pretend, promote, or posture.

- **Integrity**  
  Transparency is important. Avoid misleading claims or behaviour.

- **Respect**  
  Treat others with kindness, even when disagreeing. Debate ideas, not identities.

- **Initiative**  
  Don’t wait for someone to give direction. Start something and invite others in.

- **Collaboration**  
  Build openly, give credit, and share knowledge.

- **Modesty**  
  There’s no need to be “in charge.” Let actions and contributions speak for themselves.

Take what resonates and leave what doesn’t.

As with Kaspa: the code is open, and so is the culture.

## Constructive Participation

Some general patterns that have worked well:

- Be kind, curious, and open-minded  
- Support new contributors where possible  
- Share projects and ideas  
- Credit others when building on their ideas  
- Focus on positive contributions rather than drama

## On the Name “Kaspa Builders”

Kaspa Builders isn’t a company, a program, or a team.
  
It’s just a name for people who are actively building, supporting, or educating around Kaspa. 

People can call themselves whatever they like—Builder, Ambassador, Wizard—whatever resonates. The name is just a way to loosely describe those who actively contribute to the Kaspa ecosystem.

It’s not meant to imply:  
- Representation of Kaspa or any official group  
- Speaking on behalf of anyone else  
- Funding, endorsement, or leadership roles

## Clarifying the Relationship with the Ambassador Program

The Kaspa Ambassador Program played a meaningful role in helping the community grow early on, bringing together people from around the world to support the project through education, events, and grassroots outreach.

Kaspa Builders isn't a replacement—it’s a natural progression. Those who contributed as Ambassadors still do, and may now identify as Builders, or both. Titles aren’t what matter. What matters is the intent behind the work.

There’s no central authority deciding what people call themselves. Whether someone prefers to identify as an Ambassador, a Builder, or something else entirely, it’s up to them. There’s room for all who contribute, however they choose to label it.

This shift isn’t about abandoning structure—it’s about removing barriers.  
It welcomes participation without requiring roles, labels, or permission.

## Final Thought

If you're reading this, you're already contributing to the culture.

No one needs permission to help Kaspa grow—just the willingness to act in good faith.
