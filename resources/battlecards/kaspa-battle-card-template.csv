"KASPA

Kaspa, the world's first blockDAG and the fastest,
open-source, decentralized, and fully scalable
Layer-1 to ever exist.
A digital ledger with parallel blocks and instant
transaction confirmation — powered by a robust
proof-of-work engine with rapid single-second
block intervals.
Built by industry pioneers. led by the people.",,TRANSLATION HERE

"KASPA FEATURES

FASTEST TRANSACTIONS
Kaspa's BlockDAG technology
enables unprecedented
transaction speed, creating
blocks every second allowing
transactions to be written to the ledger
near-instantly. Latest tests at 10bps.",,TRANSLATION HERE
,,
"SCALABLE
The blockDAG architecture of
Kaspa allows handling vast
transaction volumes, a
unique feature for a truly decentralized
proof-of-work network.",,TRANSLATION HERE
,,
"SECURITY
Kaspa maintains robust
security and decentralization.
similar to Bitcoin; enhancing
efficiency with the kHeavyHash
algorithm.",,TRANSLATION HERE
,,
"BLOCKDAG
Kaspa’s BlockDAG structure
solves the orphan block
problem, allowing frequent
block generation and flexible scalability
with its unique consensus method.",,TRANSLATION HERE
,,
"GHOSTDAG
Kaspa improves upon the
PHANTOM protocol with
GhostDAG, a secure, efficient
consensus mechanism ensuring reliable
and irreversible transaction ordering.",,TRANSLATION HERE
,,
"INSTANT CONFIRMATION
Kaspa eradicates the
long-standing issue of slow
confirmations by ensuring
transactions are visible in one second
and fully confirmed in ten.",,TRANSLATION HERE
,,
"EFFICIENT PROOF-OF-WORK
Kaspa's choice of the
kHeavyHash algorithm balances
environmental concerns with
mining efficiency, avoiding the energy
waste of traditional PoW systems, and no
wasted energy on orphan blocks.",,TRANSLATION HERE

"GENERALIZED NAKAMOTO CONSENSUS
Kaspa’s consensus engine is
grounded in the mathematically
proven security of Nakamoto's
Protocol, resisting centralization while
ensuring reliability and security.",,TRANSLATION HERE

"PRUNING
Kaspa's pruning strategy maintains
a compact blockDAG, requiring
minimal storage hardware.
Lowering the cost of entry, encouraging
decentralization and inclusivity.",,TRANSLATION HERE
"RUST
The rewrite of Kaspa’s node implementation from Golang to Rust is complete. Boosting Kaspa’s overall performance/speed to 10bps. This rewrite is an integral part of Kaspas future goal of reaching 100bps!",,TRANSLATION HERE

“I would like Kaspa to be more of a long-term
contender for the open financial system, which
Ethereum lives in, while keeping faithful to the
fundamentals of a Satoshi system… In a sense,
it (Kaspa) aims to implement a vision which
once upon a time was Bitcoin's vision.”",,TRANSLATION HERE
